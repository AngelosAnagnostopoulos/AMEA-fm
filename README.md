# Go http form handler
## Author: Angelos Anagnostopoulos

#### Usage:
```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/AngelosAnagnostopoulos/FormHandler.git && cd FormHandler
$ sudo docker-compose up
```
Then, visit localhost:8080 for the form handling app and localhost:5000 for the python data visualisation app.

###### No html content is my own, it is all templates taken from html5up.net and w3docs make the page look pretty and not look at a blank white page while testing.
