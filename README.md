# Go http form handler
## Author: Angelos Anagnostopoulos

The code on main() is **absolute pants.**

#### Usage:
```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/AngelosAnagnostopoulos/FormHandler.git && cd FormHandler
$ sudo docker-compose up
```
And visit localhost:8081

### Todolist:
- Write some basic tests?

### Known issues:
- There is no event handling functionality at the moment so the form only gets submitted once because i am trying to do this in go not in js. Fix: Implement an event function.

###### No html content is my own, it is all templates taken from html5up.net and w3docs make the page look pretty and not look at a blank white page while testing.
